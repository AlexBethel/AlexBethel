### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex (he/him). I'm a slightly insane undergraduate computer
science student at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.
I'm interested in things like programming language theory, functional
programming, and cryptography. My primary language is Rust, but I also
have experience with C, Python, and Haskell, and I've fiddled with a
dozen or so other languages in the past. I'm always looking for
projects to improve my programming skills, so I've got a fair number
of random little toys on my GitHub page.
